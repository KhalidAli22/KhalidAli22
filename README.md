# Work  Experience
- ARABIC CALLIGRAPHY (2022): 
Classifies 9 different Arabic fonts using a shallow neural network and image processing techniques. Tried different features that are extracted from the images such as HoG features on several models such as NN and SVM.
- Covid19 Classifier (5-Oct-2021 -> 23-Nov- 2021)
This model is implemented in python and TensorFlow and Keras are used to build the Architecture of the model. the model uses two pretrained models (Densnet196 and Xception) which are used to extract the features from the X-Ray chest images, then the output features are fed to a fully connected layer and images are classified into three classes; COVID9 , NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.
- Flower Recognition (2-Aug-2021 -> 2-Sep-2021)
A Deep Learning Project implemented in python using PyTorch. In this project I built a small NN consists of two hidden layers to classify flower images into 102 different classes. I used regularization (dropout) to avoid overfitting and better train the network.
The model accuracy was above 85% as required. TorchVision datasets, transforms were used to read the data. 
- Optical Music Recognition (2-Sep-2020 -> 2-dec-2020)
This project got highest grade of other 18 projects. To recognize musical note, I applied different classical image processing techniques
    • Binarization main technique; image is divided into windows, calculate average of window values less than average foreground, else background. 
    • Staff lines Removal 
    • Segmentation using OpenCV, find Contours function, rejoin disjoined elements based on some conditions. 
    • Recognition using NN trained on HoG features of segmented symbols 
    • There are some techniques used as processing such as, Morphological operations. 
- Hospital (22-oct-2019 -> 22-Dec-2019)
This is a project in Database course in C#. Created Database in SQL on Microsoft SQL Server. Applied several SQL queries on the database. To mimic the day to day work in a hospital. The project has several functions 
    • Login/Sign up
    • Manager, Patient, Doctor, Employee Users
    • Add Doctor, Nurse, Employee, Patient, Appointment
    • Assign Rooms to Nurses
    • Create Prescriptions for each doctor
    • Pharmacists supply medicine
    • Book Appointment
    • Query Doctor’s Info, Doctor’s Appointments, Doctor’s Patients
    • Edit Doctors’ Info, Employee’s Info, Nurse’s Info
    • Create Statistics on different departments in database (Avg Salary, Total Income, …etc.)

- Restaurant (8-March-2019 -> 8-May-2019)
This is a project in Data Structure & algorithms course in C++. The project is built Using OOP & Data structures concepts to make a simulation to a Restaurant. The Restaurant has different branches and each branch has different types of motorcycles and deals with different orders. The project has a simple GUI to simulate the Restaurant in different modes.
